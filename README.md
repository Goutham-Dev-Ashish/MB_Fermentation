MFCS Biostat Data Processing for 2L Fermentation (Mercury Bio)
This repository contains the code and workflow for processing MFCS biostat data generated from 2L fermentation experiments used in Mercury Bio. The fermentation data, provided in CSV format, consists of large datasets that require efficient processing and analysis.

Workflow
Stage 1: Data Preprocessing
The raw fermentation data is cleaned and filtered using Excel's built-in Power Query tool to remove irrelevant or unwanted data, ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

Stage 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
An Excel spreadsheet is created, and my Python code analyzes the data and plots graphs at the end of the sheet, providing clear visual insights from the processed data.
